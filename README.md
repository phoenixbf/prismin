# PRISMIN

![Test Image 1](prismin-header.png)

The PRISMIN (Processing and transfeR of Interaction States and Mappings through Image-based eNcoding) framework, allows to encode users' interaction states and mappings into compact and lightweight images, easily *transferable* within networked contexts.

The framework provides *Interaction Volumes* as runtime accessories that can be arranged and deployed in virtual 3D scenes to capture or influence user interactions. The image-based approach, offers GPU-friendly encoding/decoding routines and easy implementations for WebGL shaders to present and inspect captured data. Furthermore, different atlas layouts allows direct manipulation and offline processing using common 2D image algorithms to extract, combine or compare user interactions.
